## Introduction

I have created the calculator UI as mentioned per the challenge.

## Tech Stack

I used 'create-react-app' for the ease of development, this helped to create a folder structure

> Development : React & Redux

> Unit testing : Jest

> Styling : less

Actual implementation is inside the "src" folder

# Getting Started

Install the modules with: `npm install`

## Run the Application

use `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Unit tests

run `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
